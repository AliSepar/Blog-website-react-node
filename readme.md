# Blog Website Project

This README provides an overview of the setup, architecture, and functionality for a blog website project. This project aims to practice handling requests between the frontend and backend using **React**, **Node.js**, **MySQL**, and **JWT** for authentication. The website will support basic **CRUD** operations, user authentication, and styling with **Sass**.

## Project Overview

This blog website enables users to:

- Register and log in.
- Create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
- View blog posts in a formatted way with a rich text editor.

The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience with handling full-stack operations, particularly focusing on the integration between frontend and backend as well as user authentication flows.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React** - for building UI components and managing application state.
- **React-Quill** - a rich text editor for adding content to blog posts.
- **Sass** - for styling components with more efficient and modular CSS.

### Backend

- **Node.js** - server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Express** - web framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests.

### Database

- **MySQL** - relational database to store user and blog data.

### Authentication and Cookies

- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** - for managing authentication securely.
- **cookie-parser** - to handle cookies in the browser, aiding in persistent user sessions.
